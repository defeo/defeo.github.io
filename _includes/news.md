**Feb 3, 2014:** The course
[*Applications Web et Sécurité (AWS)*](/aws) gets a fresh start! It
has a new webpage at <http://defeo.lu/aws>, in French. For the moment
it is rather empty, but
[stay tuned](https://github.com/defeo/aws/commits/gh-pages.atom) for
new amazing class material. You can still find the old material
[here](http://was.defeo.lu/).

**Nov 8, 2013:** I've moved! I'm now in office 309 B, on the third
floor of Descartes building. The phone number has changed too.
