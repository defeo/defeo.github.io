I research and develop algorithms for finite fields and algebraic
curves, usually with applications to cryptology in mind. I tend to put
the stress on *efficient* algorithms, both in the theoretical analysis
and the software implementation.

I am interested in computer algebra systems and expressive programming
languages for doing mathematics. I like to use
[Sage](http://www.sagemath.org) in my investigations and I have
distributed some [software](#software) using it.
