Hi, I am Luca. I am *maître de conférences* (the French equivalent of
assistant professor) in the Computer Science department of Université
de Versailles.

As part of my research, I work on
[Algorithmic Number Theory](){: popover
data-original-title="Algorithmic Number Theory" data-content="The
study of algorithms for performing number theoretic computations
(e.g. integer factorization), and of their applications. The <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Number_Theory_Symposium'>ANTS
conference series</a> is the major conference in the domain"},
[Computer Algebra](){: popover data-original-title="Computer Algebra"
data-content="The study of algorithms for the <em>symbolic
manipulation</em> of mathematical expressions and other mathematical
objects.  The <a href='http://www.issac-conference.org/'>ISSAC
conference series</a> is the major conference in the domain."} and
[Cryptology](){: popover data-original-title="Cryptology"
data-content="The study of algorithms for <em>secure</em>
communication in presence of <em>adversaries</em>. <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography'>Wikipedia
page</a>."}.
Read more about it in the [research](#research) section.

Being some kind of nerd, I am also interested in almost everything
related to Information Technology. I am fluent in many programming
languages, I enjoy learning new ones, and most of all I love mixing
them in the context of
[web programming](){: popover
data-original-title="Web Programming" data-content="The art of
programming applications for the Word Wide Web, including applications
running inside browsers, and web services. <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development'>Wikipedia
page</a>."}.
Part of my passion for these subjects flows into the
courses I [teach](#teaching), and the [software](#software) I write in
my (rare) spare time.

And, like most nerds, I tend to **share out loud** my thoughts on the
things I like. You can read more about science, maths, computer
science, web programming, etc. in my [**blog**](/blog).
